            <h2>The Chess Master</h2>
            <small>Tunde Onakoya</small>
            <p>Tunde Onakoya is a chess player and a coach. He is also the founder of Chess in the Slums an intervention designed to help children across slums in Lagos.I am quite sure that in the near future this intervention will span across the country,hopefully. This intervention not only teaches children chess but aims at teaching them to read,write and acquire basic literary skills.</p>
            <p>Tunde Onakoya was introduced to me by someone i consider an uncle during the last ASUU strike;2022. He told me he had a friend who organised chess in the slums,since then i have been intrigued by this personality that i took to follow him on twitter. He recently broke the former Guinness world record of the longest time playing chess, playing for 60 hours.</p>
            <p>Tunde is surely an inspiration to all. He is a man who gives children big caps to wear.He is prove that you can do great things from a small place. Also you just have to love his cap❤️. Now to get myself one of his caps</p>
